Introduction
Cryptography is a cornerstone of security in cloud computing, helping to ensure data
conﬁdentiality, integrity, and authenticity. In a cloud environment, sensitive data may traverse
public networks and reside on shared infrastructure, making robust cryptographic measures
essential for protecting against unauthorized access or tampering.
AWS oﬀers a comprehensive range of cryptographic services to secure data, manage encryption
keys, and protect sensitive information. These include AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for
centralized key management, AWS CloudHSM for PKCS11 applications and dedicated hardware
security modules, and the AWS Encryption SDK for client-side encryption. AWS Secrets Manager
is a service that enables you to securely store, manage, and retrieve sensitive information such
as database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. AWS Certiﬁcate
Manager (ACM) simpliﬁes the process of provisioning, managing, and deploying publicly trusted

transport layer security (TLS) certiﬁcates for use with AWS services. The AWS Private Certiﬁcate
Authority (PCA) enables you to generate and distribute x509 certiﬁcates for your internal resources.
The guide is designed to help you choose the AWS cryptography services and tools that are the
best ﬁt for your needs and your organization.
The following video is a two-minute segment of a presentation introducing best practices for
cryptography.

Understand

Choosing the right AWS cryptography services depends on your speciﬁc use case, data security
requirements, compliance obligations, and operational preferences as outlined in the following
tables.
Key management
If you need to securely manage encryption keys, consider AWS Key Management Service
(KMS). It allows you to create, rotate, and manage cryptographic keys integrated with other
AWS services. KMS uses FIPS-validated HSMs to help you meet compliance rewuirements
and to provide assurance on the correctness of the implementation of the cryptographic

primitives exposed by KMS. Some applications require certain cryptographic functions or
application interfaces that are only available with a traditional HSM and AWS CloudHSM
provides dedicated hardware security modules (HSMs) in the cloud which gives you full control
over your cryptographic keys and operations.
Data encryption
For encrypting sensitive data such as customer details or intellectual property, AWS KMS is
tightly integrated with AWS storage, database, and messaging services (e.g. S3, RDS, or EBS).
If you require client-side encryption, the AWS Encryption SDK is an open-source library that
makes it easy to encrypt data within your application before sending it to the cloud.
Secure communications
To protect data in transit, AWS Certiﬁcate Manager (ACM) simpliﬁes the management of
publicly trusted TLS certiﬁcates. Use it for asserting the identity of your internet-facing
applications and facilitating encrypting communications between your application, users, and
cloud services without worrying about certiﬁcate renewals. For internal applications, you can
use AWS Private Certiﬁcate Authority (PCA) for generating and distributing x509 certiﬁcates for
your internal resources, including both clients and servers.
Secrets and credentials management
For securely storing and retrieving application secrets such as database credentials, API keys,
or certiﬁcates, consider AWS Secrets Manager. It provides automated secret rotation and ﬁnegrained access controls. Alternatively, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store is a lower-cost
option for managing non-sensitive conﬁgurations and can integrate with AWS Secrets Manager.
Compliance and auditing
For regulatory compliance work, consider AWS KMS and AWS CloudHSM to help ensure
encryption standards are met. AWS Artifact is a self-service portal that provides on-demand
access to AWS's security and compliance reports, such as ISO certiﬁcations and SOC reports, as
well as the ability to review and accept agreements such as the Business Associate Addendum
(BAA). You can also use services like AWS Conﬁg, AWS Security Hub CSPM, and AWS Audit
Manager to monitor compliance and produce the appropriate artifacts for your own use or for
consumption by your stakeholders.
When choosing between AWS cryptography services, consider the following requirements.

By aligning your requirements with these options, you can implement cryptographic solutions
tailored to your security and operational needs.

Consider
Choosing the right AWS cryptography service involves understanding your speciﬁc security,
operational, and compliance needs. AWS oﬀers a variety of cryptographic services, each
designed to address diﬀerent use cases, from key management to data encryption and secure
communication. To make an informed decision, you should evaluate your requirements based
on several critical criteria, including your use case, control and ﬂexibility needs, compliance
obligations, cost considerations, and integration with AWS services. These criteria will help you
align your choice with your organization’s security goals and operational workﬂows.
Use case
Consider what you need the cryptographic service for: data encryption, key management,
secure communication, or secrets management. For example, AWS KMS is ideal for encryption
integrated into AWS services, while AWS CloudHSM suits organizations who need certain
cryptographic capabilities, application interfaces, or a single-tenant HSM, often due to stringent
compliance or speciﬁc application needs. Clarifying the purpose ensures you select a service
suitable for for your requirements, optimizing both functionality and cost.

Consider

AWS Decision Guide

Control and ﬂexibility
Evaluate the level of control you need over your cryptographic operations. Managed services
like AWS KMS provide ease of use with minimal management overhead with a multi-tenant
HSM while maintaining full control over your key material. In contrast, AWS CloudHSM oﬀers a
single-tenant model for speciﬁc application, cryptographic, or compliance needs.
Compliance requirements
If you operate in a regulated industry, ensure the service aligns with standards like GDPR, PCI
DSS, or HIPAA. AWS KMS and AWS CloudHSM are both FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certiﬁed. Selecting
a service that meets your non-functional requirements helps maintain trust and may avoid
potential legal or ﬁnancial penalties.
Cost considerations
Assess your budget against the service’s pricing model. AWS KMS is cost-eﬀective for general
encryption needs, while AWS CloudHSM incurs higher costs due to dedicated hardware.
Understanding cost implications helps you optimize your security expenditure.
Integration with AWS ecosystem
If you heavily use AWS services, prioritize a cryptography solution like AWS KMS or ACM that
integrates seamlessly with S3, RDS, or Lambda. This ensures smoother workﬂows and reduces
development eﬀort. Integration capabilities can signiﬁcantly enhance operational eﬃciency.
